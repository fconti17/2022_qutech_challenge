### Project Description:

The topology of QuTech Starmon-5 provides a good testing bed for small error correction circuits in an effort to achieve fault-tolerant error correction (surface code) across an entire 2D lattice of superconducting qubits. By utilizing non-demolition parity measurements we can account for both bit-flip errors and phase-flip errors on the 2-qubit Bell State codeword. This protocol was first implemented using Quantum Inspire Simulator backend, which allows for binary controlled operations. The results showed a clear recovery of the Bell State despire the intentionally induced single-qubit errors. An attempt was made to adapt the circuit to run directly on Quantum Inspire Starmon-5, but the limited connectivity and relatively low fidelity of SWAP gates did not allow for significant error correction. However, there is still a slight improvement achievable on Starmon-5 if we restrict the correction cicuit to strictly bit-flip errors.

### Personal Experience at MIT iQuHACK 2022

This was my first quantum hackathon and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I thought the dungeon escape game was a great way to kick off the event and meet some fellow hackers despite the limits of a virtual setting. The quantum error correction on Starmon-5 was a fun challenge!
